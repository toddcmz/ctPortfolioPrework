                <p><img src="images/headshot.jpg" style="border-radius:50px; float:left; margin:0px 10px 0px 10px">
                My professional career started in environmental studies with an interest in climate and energy. In undergrad,
                I worked in an ice-core laboratory, prepping samples for analysis in the mass spectrometer. This was my 
                introduction to the world of data.<br><br>After college I got a job working for an energy efficiency consulting company 
                whose clients were electric and gas utilities. I maintained an interest in human behavior and 
                social psychology throughout this work, and eventually pursued a phd in social psychology, during which time I worked
                in a social psych research lab and happened to take an advanced statistics course taught in R.<br><br> R gave me my first
                taste of coding, something I took to immediately, though I had essentially no computer science up to this point. I ended up choosing to work
                for another consulting company in the field of mental health and social services, instead of continuing work on the phd. 
                This turned out to be an excellent job where I worked every day with complicated health datasets, using R and excel to automate the data wrangling
                and analysis process, as well as to build several tools for internal project and staff planning.<br><br>While doing this,
                my interests and work started to drift away from the more analysis-focused aspects of the work, and towards
                automation, coding, and data engineering. I also developed several Shiny web applications through R for interactive data exploration and 
                dashboarding (a term I have come to regard with suspicion and apprehension.)

                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>This was a 6-month project for a client who wanted to show mental health and substance use prevalence by region
                            in the state of Oklahoma. It combined data from the Census, the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, and GIS shapefiles
                            among other sources. Roughly as much time went into the underlying data work as into learning how to implement the various
                            display approaches in Shiny. As the sole author, this project was an excellent learning opportunity and proved to me that, as happy as 
                            I was with this result, there was still a lot to learn.
                        </li>

                    <li>Fully automated R script to read in health data over time from National Outcomes Measures tool and spit out over 40 formatted summaries.
                        This made it possible to generate 10-20 separate reports showing program progress on a quarterly basis.

                <h2 id="whyDev">Why Web Development</h2>
                <p>There used to be a coffee shop in Boulder called The Cup. This was a favorite spot
                    to work. There was a large, colorful poster in the back, a cartoon-style thing of a girl
                    holding a number of balloons, with large stylized block text over the whole image. The text read, 
                    <strong style="color:red;">YOU SHOULD MAKE THINGS.</strong> Until this point in life, I hadn't made much. In fact, I had a mentality
                    that tended to keep me from making things. Looking back, it's remarkable how big changes in thinking
                    and behavior can come from seemingly small things in the moment. This poster was one of those things.
                    The more times I saw it, the more I came to think, "yeah, I <em>should</em> make things."<br><br>
                    This was long before I knew I liked and wanted to code, but I bothered to tell the story because
                    there's more to coding for me than my love of puzzles and the great feelings of satisfaction I get 
                    from automating a previously gnarly manual process: I like to create. In my mind, software engineering
                    and coding in general are all in service of <em style="color:blueviolet">adding something useful to the world,</em> which I've 
                    come to see as distinctly preferrable to merely engaging in arbitrage, or other zero sum activities (my poker habit notwithstanding).<br><br>
                    In the long run I believe my work at coding temple is going to serve a broader goal of putting my coding 
                    skills to work in data engineering applications. The more I've learned and the more I've spoken to my peers 
                    who have also completed coding bootcamps, the more I realized that the next step in my 
                    personal development needed to be a full-stack bootcamp. This is something I've long wanted to do, and I'm very excited
                    to at last have the opportunity to take the plunge.</p>

                <img src="images/gameOverview.jpg" alt="board game overview" style="float:right; height:200px;">
                <p>I'd be remiss not to mention that a friend and I have spent the last 3 years or so attempting to invent a board game.
                    We are strongly influenced by games like Catan, Firefly (the board game from the show), Scythe, and Dominion. As such,
                    we've finished our beta, and the beta art has been printed and will be arriving any day now. The game is called Skill & Stature,
                    and is an engine-builder where the aim is to become the land's next Guild Master.<br> <br>
                    We're proud to have made it this far, but now comes the difficult task of either producing it ourselves (something neither of
                    us has time for), or finding a publisher who wants to take a chance and buy it. It's been humbling to realize not only
                    to expect a litany of rejections, but also that we'd often not even <em>get the chance</em> to be rejected. 
                    We're learning that many publishers don't accept unsolicited pitches for new games. At the moment, I think our best
                    bet is to bring it to a game conference once we're finished blind-testing all the beta materials and rulebook.

                <p>Now you know all about me. Let's get to know you. What better way to do this than a game of Would You Rather?</p>

                    <h3>Q1.</h3>
                    <p>If you could get on a colony ship, that is, a spaceship headed off to start a new human colony on a previously unknown
                        planet but you could never return to Earth, would you go? Assume that you can take certain family members and friends 
                        with you, you're guaranteed to make it there in one piece and that your life expectancy upon arrival would be the same as on 
                        Earth. Also ignore any considerations related to the time of the trip; you'll go to sleep here and wake up there, if you like, 
                        or you can have brief wake-up periods in transit if you prefer, but you don't have to live out the rest of your life on the ship.

                        woods, far enough from your neighbors' houses that you can't visually see them from your property? We're not assuming anything
